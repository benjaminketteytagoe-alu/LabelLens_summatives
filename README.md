# LabelLens_summatives
Most people don't get to read and know what they consume. This is LabelLens that helps consumers to know exactly what they are consuming at what quantities and percentages. This project is a summative project and idea that I came up with. It is not just a summative project but something that solves real world problems in nutrition.
